# MuMo-CoCo
(**Mu**lti-**Mo**dal **CO**2 transport **Co**st model) A life cycle analysis and cost model for transporting CO2 by rail or truck

**Getting Started**

MuMo-CoCo is an macro-enabled Microsoft Excel-based life cycle assessment and cost model for the transport of CO2 via rail or truck in the United States. To run MuMo-CoCo, download the file to your computer and ensure Macros are enabled in Microsoft Excel.

**How to**

User inputs are selected from drop-down boxes in the _'User Interface'_ sheet. Results are automatically calculated and populated in the Results sections and graph on the same _'User Interface'_ sheet.
Input selections can be altered beyond the standard set points by manually changing the values in the _'Options'_ sheet and/or changing the 'Data Validation' range of each variable in the _'User Interface'_ sheet. 
The _'Calculations'_ sheet contains all the design equations and data sources used for calculations, except for financing. Financing calculations are performed in the _'FINEX'_ sheet.
Macros exist in the file for the calculation of boil-off gas rates and financial analyses. Macros also update available user selections based on system design choices.
